            <description>🏎️ Background Formula 1 has always facinated me, it is the pinnacle of engineering. Man and machine working in perfect harmony to eek out few thousands of a second is nothing short of mesmerising. As a fan of the sport and also someone with a passion for the data technologies I decided to put my skills and passion in the same place and work on something, I won&amp;rsquo;t call it special yet because I am yet to find the full extent of it but hopefully that I can look back and say &amp;ldquo;I worked on that.</description>

<p><em>Formula 1</em> has always facinated me, it is the pinnacle of engineering. Man and
machine working in perfect harmony to eek out few thousands of a second is
nothing short of mesmerising. As a fan of the sport and also someone with a
passion for the data technologies I decided to put my skills and passion in the
same place and work on something, I won&rsquo;t call it special yet because I am yet to
find the full extent of it but hopefully that I can look back and say &ldquo;I worked
on that.&rdquo; I mean, that is the engineering spirit at then end of the day &ndash; <em>Giving
it the best shot.</em></p>
<h2 id="-motivation">🏎️ Motivation</h2>
<p>For a few months now, my daily job (Software Dev) made me feel unsatiated.
I felt it wasn&rsquo;t going anywhere and my work wasn&rsquo;t making me happy. I needed
something to make me exicted again. That is when today when I woke up and I was
browsing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/F1Technical/">r/F1technical</a> and came across
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/F1Technical/comments/12g7wxi/code_for_f1_data_viz_website_is_now_in_a_public/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">u/Admired-Oregon&rsquo;s Post.</a></p>
<p>I knew what I had to do to get over this feeling of it. I had to use the skills
I had for my passion. I guess, this came so late to me because this was the first
time I was feeling like that and I am one to never quit, I will try and try until
I succeed (That engineering spirit talking again).</p>
<h2 id="-introduction">🏎️ Introduction</h2>
<h2 id="-technologies-and-resources">🏎️ Technologies and Resources</h2>
<p>This list will grow and expand and I will update it as and when I can but to
begin with this entails the technologies used are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Python</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="-scope">🏎️ Scope</h2>
<p>To make a platform for all F1 fans to easily understand, assimialte and view data
from F1 and make the F1 Analytics more interactive then just an arcane art reserved
for spectacled Data Scientists and Analysts.</p>
