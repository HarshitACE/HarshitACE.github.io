<h3 id="1-the-early-years-">1. The Early Years&hellip; 👶</h3>
<p>I was born 24 years ago, and have always had a particular interest in trying to <em>figure out</em> things. This led me to be nicknamed the <em>little scientist</em> in my school growing up. This knack of making <em>cool stuff</em> got glorified by the coutless hours of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter%27s_Laboratory">Dexter&rsquo;s Laboratory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_The_Animated_Series">Batman: The Animated Series</a>. That is when I knew I wanted to be a scientist and hence the career and scientific path I have taken thus far. Encyclopedias and Batman Figures became my favourite presents each year around my birthday.
I remember from when I was 8 year old I would take out my fav book (he Book of Knowledge) with a paper and pencil trying to come up with my own theorem of having wireless energy after reading about Nikola Tesla.</p>
<p>Those early years of being hungry for knowledge and having parents who supported me have been the biggest blessing in my life as I carry that <strong>*I can figure it out</strong> and <strong>I want to know and learn more</strong> attitude has remained a constant.

<h3 id="2-the-computer-bug-">2. The Computer &ldquo;Bug&rdquo; 🐞</h3>
<p>The computer &ldquo;bug&rdquo; first bit me when our school started teaching us Logo. I remember going home and using our &ldquo;dial-up&rdquo; (Remember those?) to find out how I could recreate more complex patterns on logo. Then I moved on to Java and Netbeans and the ease of creating GUI meant every other dy I was creating programs just because I could. Even if it meant it was of no use I did it just because I could. Anything from a simple but useful inventory management system to complex but not as useful space invaders clone. Then I moved on to making android apps the first one being an <em>Events Reminder App</em>. Then I got fascinated by Game Engines, picked up a book on my favourite game <strong>DOOM</strong>&rsquo;s engine and tried to implement it in C. From there new languages, new fads and new trends came and went by but what remained was my fascination with technology.</p>
<p>That feeling of knowing you can create anything you want is still carried with me, that has kept me excited about technology and learning new things. In my opinion that is one of the most powerful feeling anyone can have. The world truly feels like your oyster 🦪.</p>

<h3 id="3-college-uni-and-beyond-">3. College, Uni and beyond 📚</h3>
<p>I got into India&rsquo;s premier Computer Science university to satiate and learn from the brightest minds in my country, that helped me go beyond my surface level understanding of Computer Science. I made more than 15 top projects for different modules during my undergraduate. That experience didn&rsquo;t just help find an area of computer science that excited me more than others but also helped me understand how important teamwork is. I participated and won several Hackathons, undergraduate studies more than academics taught me life skills such as being a fair leader and a good team member. As my final year capstone project I decided to work on something that on the onset looked extremely difficult but I did it anyway because I knew I would be proud of it if that project represented my 4 years of hard work. So I made a data science project titled &lsquo;Data Analytic of F1 car sensor data&rsquo;. It finally paid off when that projet was awarded the best project for of the cohort and earned the highest grade.</p>
<p>After finishing my under</p>

<h3 id="4-my-superpower-">4. My Superpower 🦸‍♂️</h3>
<p>I believe that my superpower is my ability to never give up. I have always had a &ldquo;can-do&rdquo; attitude and a determination to find solutions to problems, no matter how difficult they may seem. This mindset has been instrumental in my ability to learn new technologies and programming languages, as well as in my ability to create innovative projects and solutions.</p>
<p>Another superpower of mine is my ability to work well in a team. I have learned the importance of teamwork through my experiences in hackathons and college projects, and I understand the value of clear communication and collaboration in achieving a common goal. I believe that my ability to be a fair leader and a good team member is a superpower that has helped me in my professional career.</p>
<p>Finally, my ability to stay curious and continuously learn is a superpower that has served me well. I have always had a passion for learning and have been able to maintain that passion even in the face of challenges and obstacles. This has helped me to keep up with the latest trends and technologies, and has also allowed me to stay ahead of the curve in my field.</p>
<p>All of these superpowers have helped me to be successful in my career so far and will continue to help me as I take on new challenges in the future.</p>

<h3 id="5-whats-next-">5. What&rsquo;s next? 🏔️</h3>
<p>As I look to the future, I am excited to continue to push the boundaries of what is possible in the field of physics and data science. My current focus is on a PhD in particle physics, where I hope to employ novel data science techniques to make new discoveries and further our understanding of the universe.</p>
<p>I believe that the intersection of physics and data science is where some of the most exciting work is happening, and I am eager to be a part of that. I intend to use my expertise in computer science and data science to develop new computational tools and methods that will enable us to analyze and interpret the massive amounts of data that are being generated by particle physics experiments.</p>
<p>One of my main goals is to use machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze particle physics data and make predictions about the behavior of subatomic particles. I believe that these methods have the potential to revolutionize the field, and I am excited to be at the forefront of this work.</p>
<p>In addition to my research, I also plan to continue to stay involved in the wider physics and data science communities. I hope to participate in conferences and workshops, share my work through publications and presentations, and collaborate with other researchers to advance our understanding of the universe.</p>
<p>Overall, I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead, and I am determined to make a meaningful contribution to the field of physics and data science through my PhD research.</p>
