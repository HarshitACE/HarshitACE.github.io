<h3 id="1-the-early-years-">1. The Early Years&hellip; 👶</h3>
<p>I was born 24 years ago, and have always had a particular interest in trying to <em>figure out</em> things. This led me to be nicknamed the <em>little scientist</em> in my school growing up. This knack of making <em>cool stuff</em> got glorified by the coutless hours of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexter%27s_Laboratory">Dexter&rsquo;s Laboratory</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman:_The_Animated_Series">Batman: The Animated Series</a>. That is when I knew I wanted to be a scientist and hence the career and scientific path I have taken thus far. Encyclopedias and Batman Figures became my favourite presents each year around my birthday.
I remember from when I was 8 year old I would take out my fav book (he Book of Knowledge) with a paper and pencil trying to come up with my own theorem of having wireless energy after reading about Nikola Tesla.</p>
<p>Those early years of being hungry for knowledge and having parents who supported me have been the biggest blessing in my life as I carry that <strong>*I can figure it out</strong> and <strong>I want to know and learn more</strong> attitude has remained a constant.

<h3 id="2-the-computer-bug-">2. The Computer &ldquo;Bug&rdquo; 🐞</h3>
<p>The computer &ldquo;bug&rdquo; first bit me when our school started teaching us Logo. I remember going home and using our &ldquo;dial-up&rdquo; (Remember those?) to find out how I could recreate more complex patterns on logo. Then I moved on to Java and Netbeans and the ease of creating GUI meant every other dy I was creating programs just because I could. Even if it meant it was of no use I did it just because I could. Anything from a simple but useful inventory management system to complex but not as useful space invaders clone. Then I moved on to making android apps the first one being an <em>Events Reminder App</em>. Then I got fascinated by Game Engines, picked up a book on my favourite game <strong>DOOM</strong>&rsquo;s engine and tried to implement it in C. From there new languages, new fads and new trends came and went by but what remained was my fascination with technology.</p>
<p>That feeling of knowing you can create anything you want is still carried with me, that has kept me excited about technology and learning new things. In my opinion that is one of the most powerful feeling anyone can have. The world truly feels like your oyster 🦪.</p>

<h3 id="3-college-uni-and-beyond-">3. College, Uni and beyond 📚</h3>
<p>I got into India&rsquo;s premier Computer Science university to satiate and learn from the brightest minds in my country, that helped me go beyond my surface level understanding of Computer Science. I made more than 15 top projects for different modules during my undergraduate. That experience didn&rsquo;t just help find an area of computer science that excited me more than others but also helped me understand how important teamwork is. I participated and won several Hackathons, undergraduate studies more than academics taught me life skills such as being a fair leader and a good team member. As my final year capstone project I decided to work on something that on the onset looked extremely difficult but I did it anyway because I knew I would be proud of it if that project represented my 4 years of hard work. So I made a data science project titled &lsquo;Data Analytic of F1 car sensor data&rsquo;. It finally paid off when that projet was awarded the best project for of the cohort and earned the highest grade.</p>
